# charlie-card-exploit-demo
Supplement material for COMP116 final project

This script is can be used to recover all keys and data of a MIFARE Classic card, such as the CharlieCard.

This script uses two tools. First, the MFCUK tool tries to recover one key out of the 32 keys in the card.
After getting one key, the MFOC tool is used to recover all other keys and all of the card's data.

The data dump is displayed on the terminal and  stored in mycardDump.mfd 

Hardware used: PN532 breakout board connected to computer by FTDI cable
Software used: libnfc, libtool, libusb, mfoc and mfcuk (available on Kali)

#TODO: use mfdread tool to convert the data dump file to human readable form
#      provide step by step guide of setup and process
